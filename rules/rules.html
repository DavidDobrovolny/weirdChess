<h1> Weird Chess Rules </h1>

It's like chess, but with weird pieces. Your goal is to kill enemy necromancer. There is no check, checkmate, castling, en pasant or promoting.


<h3> Necromancer </h3>
Necromancer moves like chess king, but cannot kill. Whenever he moves, your longest dead piece is revived on necromancer's former position. <br>

<h3> Swordsman </h3>
Swordsman moves by doing two orthogonal steps. Kills are performed by stepping next to enemy piece. <br>

<h3> Spearman </h3>
Spearman moves orthogonaly and kills diagonaly one or two tiles.<br>

<h3> Marksman </h3>
Marksman moves like chess king. Whenever he moves he kills unobscured enemy piece in opposite direction.<br>

<h3> Berserk </h3>
Berserk moves and kills exactly two tiles orthogonaly. If he kills a piece, he can continue one tile forward, diagonaly or sideways in way he started. He can kill his allied pieces.<br>

<h3> Guardian </h3>
Guardian moves and kills like chess king. He protects orthogonaly neighbouring pieces from being killed.<br>

<h3> Mage </h3>
Mage teleports up to three orthogonal steps away. If he teleports on tile with any piece, they swap places.<br>

<h3> Sapper and Mine </h3>
Sapper can go to any free tile. Whenever he moves, he leaves mine on his former position. If there is already a mine, it will be moved (there can be only one).<br>
When mine is killed, it kills piece that killed it (except marksman). Mine can kill (but not move) one tile diagonaly.<br>
